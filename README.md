# OrangeCNN
Simple convolutional neural network for Orange/Quasar using ```tensorflow```.

## Preparations
Install packages according to ```requirements.txt```.  
PyQt5 can be a bit tricky, especially on Mac OS with Apple silicon (M1, M2, ...). _Homebrew_ and _conda_ installations can work.

## Usage
- Start Orange/Quasar, e.g., using ```python -m quasar``` (in the correct environement) or starting from Anaconda Navigator.
- Load ```Module11_DeepLearning.ows``` or copy ```CNN_script.py``` into a Python widget.
- Have fun!
